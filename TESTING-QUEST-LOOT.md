# Quest Loot System - Testing Guide

## ðŸ§ª How to Test the Quest Loot System

This guide provides comprehensive methods to test and verify the Quest Loot Integration System works correctly.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Enable the System**
   ```yaml
   quest-loot:
     enabled: true
   ```

2. **Configure for Testing**
   - Set high chances (50-100%) for faster testing
   - Use specific worlds you're testing in
   - Start with manual mode for predictable results

3. **Enable Debug Mode**
   ```
   /sq debug toggle
   ```
   This will show detailed logs about loot generation in the console.

---

## Testing Chest Loot

### Step 1: Configure Chest Loot
```yaml
chest:
  enabled: true
  chance: 100              # 100% for guaranteed testing
  amount-min: 2
  amount-max: 3
  worlds: ["world"]        # Your test world
  source-mode: "manual"    # Predictable for testing
  quests:
    - "your_quest_id_here"  # Use a quest from quests.yml
```

### Step 2: Reload Configuration
```
/sq reload
```

### Step 3: Test Natural Chest Loot
1. **Find naturally generated chests:**
   - Dungeons
   - Mineshafts
   - Villages
   - Desert temples
   - Jungle temples
   - Strongholds
   - End cities

2. **Open the chest** - Quest papers should appear in the loot

3. **Verify:**
   - Check console for debug messages
   - Papers should be unbound (no player name yet)
   - Amount should be 2-3 papers
   - Quest ID should match your configured quest

### Step 4: Test with Structure Spawn
If you have structure spawn commands:
```
/locate structure minecraft:desert_pyramid
/tp @s ~ ~ ~
```
Find and open chests in those structures.

## Testing Mob Drops

### Step 1: Configure Mob Loot
```yaml
mobs:
  enabled: true
  default-chance: 0        # Turn off default
  worlds: ["world"]
  types:
    ZOMBIE:
      chance: 100          # 100% for guaranteed testing
      amount-min: 2
      amount-max: 3
```

### Step 2: Reload Configuration
```
/sq reload
```

### Step 3: Test Mob Kills
1. **Spawn test mobs:**
   ```
   /summon zombie ~ ~ ~
   ```

2. **Kill the zombie**

3. **Verify:**
   - Check console for debug messages
   - Quest papers should drop
   - Amount should be 2-3 papers
   - Papers should be unbound

### Step 4: Test Different Mob Types
Configure and test:
- Common mobs (ZOMBIE, SKELETON, CREEPER)
- Elite mobs (WITHER_SKELETON, BLAZE)
- Boss mobs (WITHER, ENDER_DRAGON)

---

## Testing Source Modes

### Manual Mode
```yaml
source-mode: "manual"
quests:
  - "quest_1"
  - "quest_2"
  - "quest_3"
```

**Expected:** Only configured quests appear

**Test:** Kill 10+ mobs, verify only quest_1, quest_2, or quest_3 appear

---

### Random Mode
```yaml
source-mode: "random"
```

**Prerequisite:** Ensure random-generator.yml is enabled and configured

**Expected:** New quests generated each time

**Test:** 
1. Kill 10+ mobs
2. Check `generated.yml` for new quest entries
3. Verify quest papers have randomized names/objectives

---

### Mixed Mode
```yaml
source-mode: "mixed"
```

**Expected:** 50/50 mix of manual and random quests

**Test:**
1. Collect 20+ quest papers
2. Verify mix of manual quest IDs and generated quest IDs
3. Check `generated.yml` for new entries

---

## Testing Quest Paper Binding

### Unbound Papers
1. **Generate loot (chest or mob)**
2. **Pick up the paper**
3. **Check lore** - Should NOT have player name initially
4. **Trade to another player**
5. **Other player uses it** - Should bind to them

### Locked Quest Papers
If your quests have `lock-to-player: true`:
1. Paper should bind immediately on first progress
2. Cannot be traded once bound
3. Check lore shows "Bound to: [PlayerName]"

---

## Testing World Filters

### Single World
```yaml
chest:
  worlds: ["world"]
mobs:
  worlds: ["world"]
```

**Test:**
1. In "world" - Should generate loot âœ“
2. In "world_nether" - Should NOT generate loot âœ—
3. In "world_the_end" - Should NOT generate loot âœ—

### Multiple Worlds
```yaml
worlds: ["world", "world_nether"]
```

**Test:**
1. In "world" - Should work âœ“
2. In "world_nether" - Should work âœ“
3. In "world_the_end" - Should NOT work âœ—

### All Worlds
```yaml
worlds: []
```

**Test:** Should work in ALL worlds âœ“

---

## Testing Amount Ranges

```yaml
amount-min: 1
amount-max: 5
```

**Test:**
1. Generate 50+ loot instances
2. Track amount per drop
3. Verify:
   - Minimum never below 1
   - Maximum never above 5
   - Distribution is random across range

---

## Testing Global Limits

```yaml
max-per-event: 3
```

**Configure mob with high amount:**
```yaml
ZOMBIE:
  chance: 100
  amount-min: 10
  amount-max: 20
```

**Test:**
1. Kill zombie
2. Count dropped quest papers
3. Should never exceed 3 (max-per-event)

---

## Debug Console Output

With `/sq debug toggle` enabled, you'll see:

```
[QuestLoot] Generating 2 quest(s) from ZOMBIE at Location{world=world,x=100,y=64,z=200}
[QuestLoot] Added 2 quest paper(s) to ZOMBIE drops
[QuestLoot] Generated quest: quest_common_kill_12345
```

### What to Look For:
- âœ“ "Generating X quest(s)" - Loot triggered
- âœ“ "Added X quest paper(s)" - Successfully added
- âœ— "Skipping" messages - Checks failed (world, chance, etc.)
- âœ— "Failed to generate" - Generation errors

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### No Quest Papers Dropping

**Check:**
1. Is system enabled? `quest-loot.enabled: true`
2. Is chest/mob loot enabled?
3. Are you in an allowed world?
4. Did chance roll succeed? (Try 100% for testing)
5. Check console for error messages

**Solution:**
```
/sq debug toggle
```
Test again and watch console for clues.

---

### Papers Not Binding

**Check:**
1. Is quest lock-to-player enabled?
2. Did player make any progress?
3. Check paper NBT data

**Solution:**
Unlocked quests only bind when player makes first progress or completes it.

---

### Wrong Quests Generating

**Check:**
1. Source mode setting
2. Manual quest IDs exist
3. Random generator is enabled

**Solution:**
```yaml
source-mode: "manual"
quests:
  - "existing_quest_id"  # Must exist in quests.yml
```

---

### Papers Stackable

**Issue:** Multiple quest papers stacking together

**This Should Not Happen:** Each paper has unique UUID and timestamp

**If it happens:** Report as bug - papers should never stack

---

## Advanced Testing

### Load Testing
1. Configure high drop rates (100%)
2. Create mob farm
3. AFK for 1 hour
4. Verify:
   - No memory leaks
   - No console spam
   - All papers functional

### Multi-World Testing
1. Configure different settings per world
2. Test in each world
3. Verify world-specific configs apply

### Permission Testing
1. Configure `obey-plugin-restrictions: true`
2. Create quest with permission requirement
3. Test with player without permission
4. Should not drop for that player

---

## Recommended Test Sequence

### Quick Test (5 minutes)
1. Set chest chance: 100%
2. Set zombie chance: 100%
3. Enable debug mode
4. Find a dungeon chest - open it
5. Spawn and kill zombie
6. Pick up papers
7. Verify they work

### Full Test (30 minutes)
1. Test each source mode
2. Test 5+ different mob types
3. Test multiple worlds
4. Test amount ranges
5. Test max-per-event limit
6. Complete a dropped quest
7. Verify random generation
8. Test with another player

### Production Test (Before Launch)
1. Set realistic chances (5-10%)
2. Disable debug mode
3. Play normally for 1+ hour
4. Collect feedback
5. Adjust chances based on drop rate
6. Monitor server performance

---

## Performance Benchmarks

**Expected Performance:**
- Chest open: < 5ms overhead
- Mob death: < 3ms overhead
- No noticeable lag
- Minimal console output (debug off)

**If experiencing issues:**
- Lower chances
- Reduce amount-max
- Limit to specific worlds
- Check for other plugin conflicts

---

## Final Verification

Before considering testing complete:

âœ… All features work as documented
âœ… No console errors
âœ… Papers are completable
âœ… Integration with existing quests works
âœ… Random generation works (if enabled)
âœ… Performance is acceptable
âœ… Configuration reloads work
âœ… Debug mode helps troubleshooting

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check `/sq debug toggle` output
2. Review server console for errors
3. Verify quest-loot.yml syntax
4. Test with minimal config first
5. Add complexity gradually

**Remember:** High chances (50-100%) make testing faster, but use realistic chances (5-15%) for production!
