## What is SoapsQuest?

SoapsQuest is a quest plugin for Paper 1.21+ servers. Players receive **physical quest papers** — actual items they hold in their inventory — and complete objectives to earn rewards. No abstract menus or invisible trackers. The quest is right there in the player's hand.

**Key highlights:**
- 🗡️ **30+ objective types** — Kill mobs, mine blocks, fish, brew, enchant, travel, and much more
- 📜 **Physical quest papers** — Quests are real items in the player's inventory
- 🎲 **Random quest generator** — Generate unlimited unique quests from templates
- 📅 **Daily & weekly quests** — Automatic recurring quest rotation
- 💎 **Tier & difficulty system** — Common through Mythic rarity, Easy through Nightmare difficulty
- 🖥️ **In-game GUI editor** — Create and edit quests without touching config files
- 🎁 **Loot system** — Quest papers drop from mobs and spawn in chests
- 📊 **Player statistics** — Track completions, rewards claimed, and more
